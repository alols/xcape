XCAPE
=====

xcape runs as a daemon and intercepts the Control key. If the 
Control key is pressed and released on its own, it will generate an Escape
key event.
This makes more sense if you have remapped your Caps Lock key to Control.
Future versions of this program might do that mapping for you, but for now
this is something that you have to do yourself.
If you don't understand why anybody would want this, I'm guessing that Vim
is not your favourite text editor ;)

Here are some minimal building instructions:
$ sudo apt-get install git gcc make libx11-dev libxtst-dev
$ mkdir xcape
$ cd xcape
$ git clone https://github.com/alols/xcape.git .
$ make
